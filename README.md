## Introduction

This project is developed as part of **CPSC 304** at the **University of British Columbia**. The main objective is to create a comprehensive Lost and Found management system for a university campus.

## Project Description

The Lost and Found Management System streamlines the process of reporting and tracking lost items, logging found items, and notifying users when there is a potential match between lost and found items based on shared attributes like description and location. The goal of the system is to enhance the efficiency of the traditional Lost and Found process by reducing the time it takes to reunite items with their rightful owners.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can register as either students or staff members.
- **Item Reporting**: Users can report lost or found items with detailed descriptions.
- **Item Tracking**: The system keeps track of all reported items and their statuses.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when there is a potential match for their lost or found items.
- **Claims**: Users can claim items, and the system updates the status accordingly.
- **Admin Interface**: For managing categories, statuses, and other system configurations.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP for server-side scripting to handle business logic and database interactions.
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS for building a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Database**: Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) provided by the department to manage and store all application data securely and efficiently.
- **Version Control**: Git for collaborative code management and tracking changes.
